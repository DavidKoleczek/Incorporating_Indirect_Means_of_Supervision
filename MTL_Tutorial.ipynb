    "# Incorporating Indirect Means of Supervision in Practice\n",
    "#### Supervised learning requires labeled training data, a learnable model, and hardware. Thanks to open source implementations, we have high-performance algorithms available that are becoming ever easier to use. Thanks to the proliferation of cloud technology, we have as much compute available as our finances allow. But the bottleneck in many cases ends up becoming the amount and quality of training data that we have, especially if exceptional accuracy is needed (like in many medical applications). This motivates the problem of **finding non-traditional means of incorporating domain knowledge into our models.**\n"

    "##### In this jupyter notebook we explore incorporating indirect means of supervision by tackling a challenging supervision problem which requires such methods to achieve quality results. We focus on a classic problem in natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis. We start from the basics by solving it using standard modeling techniques and show how we reach a limit in possible performance. We then sequentially add additional supervision **signals** and show how each can improve performance in this sentiment analysis task. We hope that this tutorial will help to bridge the gap between the recent advancements in this area to implementing them in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### This work is heavily inspired by research born out of the Standard AI Lab and the creators of the open-source library Snorkel. Particular inspiration was taken from their writeup, [Massive Multi-Task Learning with Snorkel MeTaL: Bringing More Supervision to Bear](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2019/03/22/glue/)."

    "\n",
    "### Why Financial Phrase Bank? \n",
    "- Finacial data is often proprietary and scarce. \n",
    "    - Any improvement we can get from publicly available methods, domain knowledge, or data we thought previously could not be applied is immensely valuable.\n",
    "- Due to the heavy dependence on semantic meaning in determining sentiment, it is a challenging problem where using only traditional supervision might not provide satisfactory results.\n",
    "- Either of previous two points are common with many other problems."

    "### [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) is a massive pretrained language model. It is a contextual model that generates a representation of each word based on the other words in the sentence. It has various forms, but the one we will use has 110 million parameters and was trained on the BooksCorpus which has 800 million words. As we will show, BERT  can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of tasks, without the need for task-specific architectural modifications. Training times are also incredibly manageable given the size of the network. One iteration (which is almost all you need) on the PhraseBank dataset takes under 20 seconds with a NVIDIA 2070 Super, a midrange consumer-grade GPU. \n",
